Some people will even bring two pairs in case one gets wet. Personally, I bring a pair of mittens for warmth and a pair of gloves for added dexterity.\\nWhen selecting mittens and gloves for winter conditions, here are a couple of must-have features that you should look for:\\nRemovable liners: You need a mitten or glove system that has liners and a removable shell so you don’t overheat and sweat. Sweat in winter is nasty because it freezes in place and chills you, so you have to be extra vigilant about removing layers when you get hot and slow your activity levels to the point where you can stay dry. You can also put removable liners in your sleeping bag at night to dry them.\\nWaterproof, breathable shell: When you sweat you need a shell fabric that has the ability to vent moisture and prevent it from getting in. Higher denier (tougher) Gore-Tex shells work great for this. EVent shells are also available which may be more breathable but are also slightly heavier.\\nGauntlets: These cover the veins in your wrists and eliminate heat loss there. They also prevent drafts from entering your parka/soft shell sleeves and chilling your arms. The gauntlets should have built in tighteners and leashes or tethers that prevent them from being blown off your hands or from getting lost. This would be very dangerous in cold weather conditions.\\nAnatomically curved fingers: On thicker gloves, dexterity and comfort are greatly improved if the palms and fingers are anatomically pre-curved.\\nFor example, I own a pair of Outdoor Research Cornice Mittens, shown above.\\nThe Cornice mittens have a removable liner with fleece on the palm and lofted insulation on the back of the hand for extra warmth. The shell is a seam taped waterproof, breathable, highly durable Gore-Tex 3-layer 330 denier Cordura shell that is anatomically curved for better dexterity. The gauntlets have elastic locking cinches at their base which you can tighten down to keep the wind out, in addition to an idiot cord. There’s also a nice wrist cinch strap that you can tighten to keep the mitten from slipping off your hand.\\nDisclosure: Philip Werner (SectionHiker.com) purchased this mittens with his own funds.\\nMost Popular Searches\\n- gore tex mitten shell\\n- gore tex mittens\\n- mitten shells', 'The Roman Catholic Church loves them some babies, babies from incest, babies from rape, babies from unmarried consenting adults, doesn’t matter. They’re all good. But their view on parents is whacked out. For example, when a teacher and her husband turned to in vitro fertilization, the church canned her despite exemplary performance. Not sure how this will play out legally, because it turns out churches get a special pass on discrimination unavailable to any other employer:\\n(HuffPo) — The U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously in January that religious workers can’t sue their employers for job discrimination because anti-discrimination laws allow for a “ministerial exception.” But the justices failed to define who was and who wasn’t a religious employee.”The Supreme Court didn’t give us a kind of neat little on-off test as to who’s a minister and who isn’t,” said Rick Garnett, associate dean and professor of law at Notre Dame Law School.\\nIn a similar case in Ohio, a federal judge last month gave the go-ahead for a trial in a lawsuit against the Archdiocese of Cincinnati by a parochial school teacher who was fired after she became pregnant through artificial insemination, which the church is also against. The archdiocese fired Christa Dias in 2010, saying the single woman violated church doctrine.\\nU.S. District Judge Arthur Spiegel said in his March 29 ruling that the ministerial exception did not apply because Dias was a non-Catholic computer teacher with no role in ministering or teaching Catholic doctrine.\\nOK, fine. So what would stop a “church” from setting up shop, using neo-confederate theology, and discriminating against whatever minorities, they happened to feel superior to? What would stop a mosque or a synagogue from following suit?', 'Event planning is a challenging but rewarding job that requires a very special kind of person. It requires a keen eye for detail, meticulous organization, and saint-like patience. It can be tedious, unpredictable, and even dangerous – but there’s an app for that. Several.\\nDespite the inherent advantages of mobile technologies built specifically for event planning, a recent survey showed that 59 percent of event professionals do not use mobile apps in their event planning, but that 53 percent of those were interested in getting one. That’s a sure sign of a market on the brink of explosion.', 'Too often, there is panic when an organization experiences an executive vacancy.\\nGiven that most nonprofits are strapped for resources, board members face the real possibility they might have to step in and do that work because there is no surplus internal staff capacity.\\nBoards, then, often feel forced to consider short-term questions. How quickly can we fill this position? Who do we already know in this field? Can we quickly post the current job description? Can we fill it internally with someone who already knows everything?\\nBut the exit of a senior staffer should be a strategic choice point – an opportunity to look forward to future needs without having to consider the presence, capacity and limitations of the departing executive.\\nThis is the prime time to assess an organization’s business model and staffing to determine what is needed to advance the organization’s mission.\\nFor some nonprofits, a professional interim executive can play the key role in that succession planning by providing the opportunity to disconnect from the previous executive.\\nThe Presbyterian Church, for example, has long insisted that a retiring senior pastor be followed by an interim preacher, from outside, to break the congregation’s ties to the former pastor.\\nThis exercise serves to open up the church to what comes next.\\nA nonprofit with a skilled interim executive in place can disconnect in a similar fashion from its former leader and thoughtfully assess next steps, all while the daily operation of the organization forges ahead.\\nMoving too quickly to fill a vacancy can result in the candidate who most resembles the departing executive or who is his or her polar opposite.\\nSuch a selection often is a reaction to previous skills and personality rather than an objective assessment of what’s most needed.\\nSometime boards select a prominent retired business leader as the interim, then congratulate themselves on a distinguished placement.\\nBut without prior nonprofit experience, even an experienced corporate executive can have difficulty adjusting to work life without personal staff, which can mean doing their own filing and PowerPoint presentations, ordering their own supplies, making high-level presentations and then stopping at the grocery store to pick up napkins for a fundraising reception.\\nIt is equally important to consider the impact of asking an internal staff member to serve as the interim.\\nThat person likely is already over-burdened, and being asked to assume additional work might not be welcome, even if these are higher level responsibilities.\\nAnd an internal staff interim can potentially create negative impact after the successor executive is hired.\\nIs he or she a candidate for the position? Will she be paid more? When the interim period is over, will she be “demoted” back to her former position? Why is it she could be capable of assuming interim executive duties but not qualified for the permanent position?\\nContracting with a professionally trained and experienced interim executive can be smart succession planning.\\nAn experienced interim can keep the staff engaged, donors interested and the board appropriately involved during the search for a permanent hire.\\nUltimately, an interim executive can provide the board of directors with the opportunity to determine how best to move into a successful future.\\nKathy Ridge is the founder of Edvance Consulting Group, a North Carolina-based firm that provides education and nonprofit consulting and interim executive services.', 'Here are the stats for Midlifewanderlust1965\\nViews 460 (A New High)\\nFollowers 82 (+13)\\nTotal Tweets 10,715\\nIt is going to be a quiet April.

In New Orleans, that question was far from academic in 2005 after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. In fact, the question was literal; at the end of the 2005-6 school year, the city only had six schools in operation. Before Katrina, they may as well have had only six, as they had one of the worst-performing school districts in the nation. As one person relates in this Reason TV video, one school had a valedictorian who could not pass a graduation exam in six attempts despite getting straight As in high school.\\nNew Orleans had a choice in creating a new school system — and choice became a first principle, as Nick Gillespie explains:\\nBefore hurricane Katrina ravaged the city in 2005, New Orleans had one of the worst performing public school districts in the nation. Katrina forced nearly a million people to leave their homes and caused almost $100 billion in damages. To an already failing public school system, the storm seemed to provide the final deathblow. But then something amazing happened. In the wake of Katrina, education reformers decided to seize the opportunity and start fresh with a system based on choice.\\nToday, New Orleans has the most market-based school system in the US. Sixty percent of New Orleans students currently attend charter schools, test scores are up, and talented and passionate educators from around the country are flocking to New Orleans to be a part of the education revolution. It’s too early to tell if the New Orleans experiment in school choice will succeed over the long term, but for the first time in decades people are optimistic about the future of New Orleans schools.\\nThe key attributes are competition, parental choice, investment, and an end to the union deathgrip on New Orleans schools that kept children locked into failing schools and failing classrooms. Parents in New Orleans have hope now that their children will get educated rather than baby-sat, and that will provide a renaissance of its own to a city struggling to get back on its feet.\\nOtherwise, we’ll end up with this, courtesy of Bob Ewing at the Daily Caller:\\nEveryone knew OSP would be a bargain. DC has among the highest spending per pupil in the nation. At a conservative estimate of $17,542, the public schools spend over $10,000 more per child than the $7,500 spent through the scholarship program.\\nBut would OSP achieve measureable results?\\nThe answer is a resounding yes. Previous studies by Wolf showed an improvement in academic performance, to the point that a student participating in OSP from kindergarten through high school would likely be 2 ½ years ahead in reading. The key finding in this final round of research, Wolf told us, was the graduation rates. OSP dramatically increases prospects of high-school graduation.\\nWolf pointed to research showing that high-school diplomas significantly improve the chance of getting a job. And dropouts that do find employment earn about $8,500 less per year than their counterpoints with diplomas. Further, each graduate reduces the cost of crime by a stunning $112,000. Cecelia Rouse, an economic advisor to President Obama, found that each additional high school graduate saves the country $260,000.\\nSimply put, OSP has a profoundly positive effect not just on students, but on the city and the country as a whole.\\nSo when it came time for Congress to reauthorize OSP, it would seem to be a no-brainer: Expand the program.\\nInstead, they killed it.\\nOf course. They haven’t had a Katrina to refocus Congress on what ails education; instead, they’re acting in thrall to the teachers union. Be sure to read it all; it’s as depressing as the Reason TV video is uplifting.', 'Explanation dashboard symbols\\nIn this guide all symbols and elements from the Survey Anyplace dashboard will be explained.\\n- The navigation menu\\n- All recent activity to check which survey got a response recently\\n- Number of responses over different periods\\n- The dashboard to manage all of your surveys\\n- Click here to create a new survey/quiz.\\n- You probably clicked on this button to wind up here.\\n- If you want to go to the dashboard and have an overview of all your surveys, click on this \\'Dashboard\\' button\\n- Via \\'Survey\\' you go to the editor tabs of the survey you last edited.\\n- Via \"Results\\' you go to the results of the survey you last edited\\n- Via \\'Upgrade/invoices\\' you can manage your account and licenses.\\n- User Management allows you to work together with your colleagues.

KCR’s government has set many expectations among the people about the beautification and cleanliness that the city is going to grasp. But now the horrible situation in the city has exposed the hollowness of the promises given by the Telangana Government. Actually the city turned from bad to worse. The entire city of Hyderabad has turned into a muddy well. The inefficiently designed drainage system could not cope up with the recent heavy rains and the roads are totally turned into ruins. Whether it is old city or Banjara Hills or Hi-Tech City, no matter where, everything looks the same.\\nOn the other hand, the minister of urban development, Mr. KTR wants to bring-up the city to make another Dallas. He also announced a 100-day pilot program to beautify the city. Of course, this order was passed just before the GHMC elections. After that elections are gone and the beautification plan also gone.\\nNo wonder, people are now questioning KTR directly through letters and tweets. Senior Congress leader and former MP V Hanumantha Rao demanded that KTR resign immediately for failing to maintain proper roads in the city. All the opposition leaders have already started questing the government.

      "{'text': ['If you go winter backpacking, snowshoeing, or mountaineering, you are going to want to bring at least one pair of mittens. Some people will even bring two pairs in case one gets wet. Personally, I bring a pair of mittens for warmth and a pair of gloves for added dexterity.\\nWhen selecting mittens and gloves for winter conditions, here are a couple of must-have features that you should look for:\\nRemovable liners: You need a mitten or glove system that has liners and a removable shell so you don’t overheat and sweat. Sweat in winter is nasty because it freezes in place and chills you, so you have to be extra vigilant about removing layers when you get hot and slow your activity levels to the point where you can stay dry. You can also put removable liners in your sleeping bag at night to dry them.\\nWaterproof, breathable shell: When you sweat you need a shell fabric that has the ability to vent moisture and prevent it from getting in. Higher denier (tougher) Gore-Tex shells work great for this. EVent shells are also available which may be more breathable but are also slightly heavier.\\nGauntlets: These cover the veins in your wrists and eliminate heat loss there. They also prevent drafts from entering your parka/soft shell sleeves and chilling your arms. The gauntlets should have built in tighteners and leashes or tethers that prevent them from being blown off your hands or from getting lost. This would be very dangerous in cold weather conditions.\\nAnatomically curved fingers: On thicker gloves, dexterity and comfort are greatly improved if the palms and fingers are anatomically pre-curved.\\nFor example, I own a pair of Outdoor Research Cornice Mittens, shown above.\\nThe Cornice mittens have a removable liner with fleece on the palm and lofted insulation on the back of the hand for extra warmth. The shell is a seam taped waterproof, breathable, highly durable Gore-Tex 3-layer 330 denier Cordura shell that is anatomically curved for better dexterity. The gauntlets have elastic locking cinches at their base which you can tighten down to keep the wind out, in addition to an idiot cord. There’s also a nice wrist cinch strap that you can tighten to keep the mitten from slipping off your hand.\\nDisclosure: Philip Werner (SectionHiker.com) purchased this mittens with his own funds.\\nMost Popular Searches\\n- gore tex mitten shell\\n- gore tex mittens\\n- mitten shells', 'The Roman Catholic Church loves them some babies, babies from incest, babies from rape, babies from unmarried consenting adults, doesn’t matter. They’re all good. But their view on parents is whacked out. For example, when a teacher and her husband turned to in vitro fertilization, the church canned her despite exemplary performance. Not sure how this will play out legally, because it turns out churches get a special pass on discrimination unavailable to any other employer:\\n(HuffPo) — The U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously in January that religious workers can’t sue their employers for job discrimination because anti-discrimination laws allow for a “ministerial exception.” But the justices failed to define who was and who wasn’t a religious employee.”The Supreme Court didn’t give us a kind of neat little on-off test as to who’s a minister and who isn’t,” said Rick Garnett, associate dean and professor of law at Notre Dame Law School.\\nIn a similar case in Ohio, a federal judge last month gave the go-ahead for a trial in a lawsuit against the Archdiocese of Cincinnati by a parochial school teacher who was fired after she became pregnant through artificial insemination, which the church is also against. The archdiocese fired Christa Dias in 2010, saying the single woman violated church doctrine.\\nU.S. District Judge Arthur Spiegel said in his March 29 ruling that the ministerial exception did not apply because Dias was a non-Catholic computer teacher with no role in ministering or teaching Catholic doctrine.\\nOK, fine. So what would stop a “church” from setting up shop, using neo-confederate theology, and discriminating against whatever minorities, they happened to feel superior to? What would stop a mosque or a synagogue from following suit?', 'Event planning is a challenging but rewarding job that requires a very special kind of person. It requires a keen eye for detail, meticulous organization, and saint-like patience. It can be tedious, unpredictable, and even dangerous – but there’s an app for that. Several.\\nDespite the inherent advantages of mobile technologies built specifically for event planning, a recent survey showed that 59 percent of event professionals do not use mobile apps in their event planning, but that 53 percent of those were interested in getting one. That’s a sure sign of a market on the brink of explosion.', 'Too often, there is panic when an organization experiences an executive vacancy.\\nGiven that most nonprofits are strapped for resources, board members face the real possibility they might have to step in and do that work because there is no surplus internal staff capacity.\\nBoards, then, often feel forced to consider short-term questions. How quickly can we fill this position? Who do we already know in this field? Can we quickly post the current job description? Can we fill it internally with someone who already knows everything?\\nBut the exit of a senior staffer should be a strategic choice point – an opportunity to look forward to future needs without having to consider the presence, capacity and limitations of the departing executive.\\nThis is the prime time to assess an organization’s business model and staffing to determine what is needed to advance the organization’s mission.\\nFor some nonprofits, a professional interim executive can play the key role in that succession planning by providing the opportunity to disconnect from the previous executive.\\nThe Presbyterian Church, for example, has long insisted that a retiring senior pastor be followed by an interim preacher, from outside, to break the congregation’s ties to the former pastor.\\nThis exercise serves to open up the church to what comes next.\\nA nonprofit with a skilled interim executive in place can disconnect in a similar fashion from its former leader and thoughtfully assess next steps, all while the daily operation of the organization forges ahead.\\nMoving too quickly to fill a vacancy can result in the candidate who most resembles the departing executive or who is his or her polar opposite.\\nSuch a selection often is a reaction to previous skills and personality rather than an objective assessment of what’s most needed.\\nSometime boards select a prominent retired business leader as the interim, then congratulate themselves on a distinguished placement.\\nBut without prior nonprofit experience, even an experienced corporate executive can have difficulty adjusting to work life without personal staff, which can mean doing their own filing and PowerPoint presentations, ordering their own supplies, making high-level presentations and then stopping at the grocery store to pick up napkins for a fundraising reception.\\nIt is equally important to consider the impact of asking an internal staff member to serve as the interim.\\nThat person likely is already over-burdened, and being asked to assume additional work might not be welcome, even if these are higher level responsibilities.\\nAnd an internal staff interim can potentially create negative impact after the successor executive is hired.\\nIs he or she a candidate for the position? Will she be paid more? When the interim period is over, will she be “demoted” back to her former position? Why is it she could be capable of assuming interim executive duties but not qualified for the permanent position?\\nContracting with a professionally trained and experienced interim executive can be smart succession planning.\\nAn experienced interim can keep the staff engaged, donors interested and the board appropriately involved during the search for a permanent hire.\\nUltimately, an interim executive can provide the board of directors with the opportunity to determine how best to move into a successful future.\\nKathy Ridge is the founder of Edvance Consulting Group, a North Carolina-based firm that provides education and nonprofit consulting and interim executive services.', 'Here are the stats for Midlifewanderlust1965\\nViews 460 (A New High)\\nFollowers 82 (+13)\\nTotal Tweets 10,715\\nIt is going to be a quiet April.

In New Orleans, that question was far from academic in 2005 after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. In fact, the question was literal; at the end of the 2005-6 school year, the city only had six schools in operation. Before Katrina, they may as well have had only six, as they had one of the worst-performing school districts in the nation. As one person relates in this Reason TV video, one school had a valedictorian who could not pass a graduation exam in six attempts despite getting straight As in high school.\\nNew Orleans had a choice in creating a new school system — and choice became a first principle, as Nick Gillespie explains:\\nBefore hurricane Katrina ravaged the city in 2005, New Orleans had one of the worst performing public school districts in the nation. Katrina forced nearly a million people to leave their homes and caused almost $100 billion in damages. To an already failing public school system, the storm seemed to provide the final deathblow. But then something amazing happened. In the wake of Katrina, education reformers decided to seize the opportunity and start fresh with a system based on choice.\\nToday, New Orleans has the most market-based school system in the US. Sixty percent of New Orleans students currently attend charter schools, test scores are up, and talented and passionate educators from around the country are flocking to New Orleans to be a part of the education revolution. It’s too early to tell if the New Orleans experiment in school choice will succeed over the long term, but for the first time in decades people are optimistic about the future of New Orleans schools.\\nThe key attributes are competition, parental choice, investment, and an end to the union deathgrip on New Orleans schools that kept children locked into failing schools and failing classrooms. Parents in New Orleans have hope now that their children will get educated rather than baby-sat, and that will provide a renaissance of its own to a city struggling to get back on its feet.\\nOtherwise, we’ll end up with this, courtesy of Bob Ewing at the Daily Caller:\\nEveryone knew OSP would be a bargain. DC has among the highest spending per pupil in the nation. At a conservative estimate of $17,542, the public schools spend over $10,000 more per child than the $7,500 spent through the scholarship program.\\nBut would OSP achieve measureable results?\\nThe answer is a resounding yes. Previous studies by Wolf showed an improvement in academic performance, to the point that a student participating in OSP from kindergarten through high school would likely be 2 ½ years ahead in reading. The key finding in this final round of research, Wolf told us, was the graduation rates. OSP dramatically increases prospects of high-school graduation.\\nWolf pointed to research showing that high-school diplomas significantly improve the chance of getting a job. And dropouts that do find employment earn about $8,500 less per year than their counterpoints with diplomas. Further, each graduate reduces the cost of crime by a stunning $112,000. Cecelia Rouse, an economic advisor to President Obama, found that each additional high school graduate saves the country $260,000.\\nSimply put, OSP has a profoundly positive effect not just on students, but on the city and the country as a whole.\\nSo when it came time for Congress to reauthorize OSP, it would seem to be a no-brainer: Expand the program.\\nInstead, they killed it.\\nOf course. They haven’t had a Katrina to refocus Congress on what ails education; instead, they’re acting in thrall to the teachers union.

KCR’s government has set many expectations among the people about the beautification and cleanliness that the city is going to grasp. But now the horrible situation in the city has exposed the hollowness of the promises given by the Telangana Government. Actually the city turned from bad to worse. The entire city of Hyderabad has turned into a muddy well. The inefficiently designed drainage system could not cope up with the recent heavy rains and the roads are totally turned into ruins. Whether it is old city or Banjara Hills or Hi-Tech City, no matter where, everything looks the same.\\nOn the other hand, the minister of urban development, Mr. KTR wants to bring-up the city to make another Dallas. He also announced a 100-day pilot program to beautify the city. Of course, this order was passed just before the GHMC elections. After that elections are gone and the beautification plan also gone.\\nNo wonder, people are now questioning KTR directly through letters and tweets. Senior Congress leader and former MP V Hanumantha Rao demanded that KTR resign immediately for failing to maintain proper roads in the city. All the opposition leaders have already started questing the government. People are waiting to see where their city roads are going to lead them in the future.', 'Glow-In-The-Dark Glow Gloves\\nGet glowing this Halloween and wear Glow-In-The-Dark Glow Gloves!
